# Session: Initial Vault Setup

## What Happened

First session setting up the AI-ready vault structure. Discussed folder organization, memory types, and working agreement.

## Key Decisions

- Use PARA-style folder structure
- Memory organized by type (episodic, semantic, procedural, strategic)
- Session logs capture all collaboration sessions

## Insights

The memory system works best when:
- Memories are created immediately after sessions
- Each memory has clear tags and links
- Regular consolidation prevents sprawl
