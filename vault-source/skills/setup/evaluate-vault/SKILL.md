# Evaluate Vault

Check vault AI-readiness with pass/fail indicators.

## Checks Performed

| Check | Pass Condition | Priority |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| CLAUDE.md exists | File present at vault root | Critical |
| CLAUDE.md sections | Contains Overview, Structure, Preferences | Critical |
| Memory folders | All 4 type folders exist | High |
| Memory.md dashboard | Dashboard file present | High |
| Example memories | At least 1 memory file exists | Medium |
| Skills directory | skills/ folder present | Medium |

## Workflow

1. Check for CLAUDE.md
   - Does it exist at vault root?
   - Does it contain required sections?

2. Verify memory system structure
   - Does `Areas/AI/Memory/` exist?
   - Are all 4 type folders present? (Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Strategic)
   - Is Memory.md dashboard present?
   - Are there any example memories?

3. Check for skills
   - Does skills/ directory exist?

4. Calculate score
   - Count passed checks out of total
   - Assign qualitative rating

5. Generate recommendations
   - Actionable steps for any failed checks
   - Next steps for improvement

## Scoring

| Score | Rating |
|-------|--------|
| 6/6 | Excellent |
| 5/6 | Good |
| 4/6 | Needs Work |
| <4/6 | Not Ready |
