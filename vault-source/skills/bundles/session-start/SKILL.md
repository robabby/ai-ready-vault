# Session Start

Combined startup workflow for AI collaboration sessions.

## What It Does

1. **Hydrate** - Load vault context and relevant memories
2. **Vault Status** - Show recent activity and current state
3. **Focus Prompt** - Ask what to work on this session

## Workflow

1. Run hydrate workflow
   - Read CLAUDE.md
   - Load recent session context
   - Surface relevant memories
   - If $ARGUMENTS provided, focus hydration on that topic

2. Run vault-status (abbreviated)
   - Recent file changes
   - Today's daily note status
   - Any pending items from last session

3. Present session context
   - Summarize loaded context
   - Note any unfinished work
   - Highlight relevant memories

4. Ask for session focus
   - "What would you like to focus on today?"
   - Or proceed with topic from $ARGUMENTS

## Parameters

- `$ARGUMENTS` (optional): Topic to focus the session on
