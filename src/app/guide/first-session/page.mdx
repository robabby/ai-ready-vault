## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- **Downloaded the vault** from the [downloads page](/downloads) and unzipped it
- **Obsidian** installed ([obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md))
- **Claude Code** installed (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)

## Step 1: Open Your Vault

First, open the downloaded vault in Obsidian.

1. Unzip the downloaded `ai-ready-vault.zip` file
2. Open Obsidian
3. Click "Open folder as vault"
4. Navigate to the unzipped folder and select it

You should see the vault structure with folders like `Areas/`, `Projects/`, and files like `CLAUDE.md` and `Home.md`.

```
Output
ai-ready-vault/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── Home.md
├── Areas/
│   └── AI/
│       ├── Memory/
│       └── Collaboration/
├── Projects/
├── Resources/
└── skills/
```

Take a moment to explore. Open `CLAUDE.md` to see how the vault introduces itself to Claude.

## Step 2: Launch Claude Code

Open your terminal and navigate to the vault directory.

```bash
cd ~/path/to/ai-ready-vault
```

Then start Claude Code:

```bash
claude
```

Claude Code automatically reads the `CLAUDE.md` file in the current directory. This gives Claude immediate context about your vault's structure, purpose, and working agreements.

```
Output
╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Claude Code                                         │
│ /help for commands                                  │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

>
```

You're now ready to collaborate.

## Step 3: Hydrate Your Session

The `/hydrate` skill loads relevant context at the start of a session. Run it now:

```
/hydrate
```

On your first session, hydration will be minimal since there's no session history yet. That's expected.

```
Output
Using skill: hydrate

Checking vault context...
✓ CLAUDE.md loaded
✓ Memory system structure found
✓ No recent sessions (this is your first!)

Ready to collaborate. This vault is set up for AI-assisted knowledge
management with a memory system for cross-session persistence.

What would you like to work on?
```

As you use the vault more, `/hydrate` will load recent sessions, relevant memories, and ongoing work context.

## Step 4: Explore Your Vault

Now ask Claude a question about the vault. This demonstrates how Claude can read and navigate the structure.

```
What's in this vault? Give me a quick overview.
```

Claude will read through the key files and summarize:

```
Output
Let me explore the vault structure...

Reading: CLAUDE.md
Reading: Home.md
Reading: Areas/AI/Memory/

This AI-ready vault is set up for knowledge management with
AI collaboration. Key areas:

• Projects/ - Active, backlog, and completed work
• Areas/AI/Memory/ - Long-term memory storage (Episodic,
  Semantic, Procedural, Strategic)
• Resources/ - Reference material
• skills/ - 13 skills for session management (/hydrate,
  /remember, /recall, /reflect, etc.)

The vault follows a modified PARA structure optimized for
AI navigation. CLAUDE.md provides working agreements and
current focus.
```

This is the power of an AI-ready vault—Claude understands the structure without you explaining it each time.

## Step 5: Create Your First Memory

The `/remember` skill stores information for future sessions. Let's create your first memory:

```
/remember I completed the first-session tutorial and my vault is working correctly
```

Claude will create a memory file with proper categorization:

```
Output
Using skill: remember

Creating memory...

Type: Episodic (a specific event/experience)
Importance: 0.6 (moderately significant milestone)
Concepts: [first-session, setup, tutorial, vault-working]

Created: Areas/AI/Memory/Episodic/2024-01-15 - First Session Complete.md

✓ Memory stored successfully

This memory will be available in future sessions when you
run /hydrate or /recall.
```

Open Obsidian and check `Areas/AI/Memory/Episodic/`—you'll see the new file with frontmatter metadata and your memory content.

## Step 6: End Your Session

The `/reflect` skill captures session learnings before you close out. Run it now:

```
/reflect
```

Claude reviews what happened and creates appropriate memories:

```
Output
Using skill: reflect

Reviewing session...

Session Summary:
• Completed first-session tutorial
• Explored vault structure
• Created first memory
• Learned hydrate → work → reflect cycle

Memories to preserve:
✓ Episodic: First session complete (already stored)

No additional memories needed—the key learning (first session
complete) was already captured.

Session preserved. Next time you run /hydrate, this context
will be available.
```

The reflect skill is smart—it won't create duplicate memories if you've already captured the important points.

## Step 7: Success

You've completed your first AI-ready session. Here's what you accomplished:

1. **Opened your vault** in Obsidian
2. **Launched Claude Code** with automatic context from CLAUDE.md
3. **Hydrated** to load session context (minimal on first run)
4. **Explored** the vault structure with Claude
5. **Created a memory** that persists across sessions
6. **Reflected** to capture session learnings

### The Session Cycle

You've now experienced the core workflow:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                     │
│   /hydrate  →  work  →  /remember  →  /reflect     │
│       ↑                                    │        │
│       └────────────────────────────────────┘        │
│                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each session builds on the last. Memories accumulate. Context deepens.

### Next Steps

Now that your vault is working:

- **Customize CLAUDE.md** with your actual name, projects, and preferences
- **Explore other skills** in the `skills/` folder (`/recall`, `/glean`, `/evaluate-vault`)
- **Create project notes** in `Projects/Active/` and reference them in sessions
- **Read the full guide** at [/guide](/guide) for deeper understanding

Your notes are now AI memory. Happy collaborating.
